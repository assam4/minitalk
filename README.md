# Minitalk 

42school project is devoted to familiarization of work with signaling (in particular UNIX).

In the project I used libft, ft_printf.
 
## Features of my project 

• introduction of queue of clients (our server can handle several clients (outside the subjct),

• byte buffering for optimal system calls (write, malloc) ,

• timeouts to avoid hangs both in client side and server side.
